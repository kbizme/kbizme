👋 Hi, I’m Kartick Bhowmik

💻 I build Python-based systems focused on data pipelines, automation, and GenAI-powered applications.

🧠 My work spans:
- Designing scalable backend architectures
- Building robust web scrapers and data ingestion pipelines
- Developing GenAI applications (RAG, LLM orchestration, retrieval workflows)
- Systematic data analysis and research-driven tooling

🚀 Currently:
- Developing a production-grade Python scraper and data pipeline for the NSE exchange
- Building GenAI applications with a focus on reliability, structure, and real-world constraints
- Iterating on personal systems combining data engineering and AI reasoning

🤝 Open to collaborating on:
- Python backend systems
- GenAI / RAG applications
- Data engineering, scraping, and automation projects
