👋 Hi, I’m Kartick Bhowmik

💻 I build Python-based systems focused on data pipelines, automation, and GenAI-powered applications.

🧠 My work spans:
- Designing scalable backend architectures for data- and AI-driven systems
- Building robust web scrapers and data ingestion pipelines (batch & incremental)
- Developing GenAI applications, including RAG pipelines, LLM orchestration, and retrieval workflows using Pinecone and LangChain/LangGraph.
- Working with embeddings, similarity search, and structured data preparation for LLM consumption
- Building and experimenting with GenAI workflows on cloud platforms (Vertex AI, Amazon Bedrock, SageMaker Studio)
- Systematic data analysis and research-driven tooling

🚀 Currently:
- Developing a production-grade Python scraper and data pipeline for the NSE exchange
- Building GenAI applications that integrate LLM APIs with retrieval layers and structured data
- Focusing on reliability, structure, and real-world constraints in AI-backed systems
- Iterating on personal systems combining data engineering and AI reasoning

🤝 Open to collaborating on:
- Python backend and API-driven systems
- GenAI / RAG applications (retrieval, prompt design, orchestration)
- Data engineering, scraping, automation, and AI-powered pipelines
